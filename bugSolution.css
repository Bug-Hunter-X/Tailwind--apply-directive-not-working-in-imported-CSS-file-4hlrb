The solution involves using Tailwind's `@layer` directive to correctly apply the utility classes. By explicitly defining the layer where the `@apply` directives are placed, the problem is resolved.  The `@apply` directives within the imported CSS file should be wrapped inside a `@layer` block, typically within the `components` layer if these styles apply to components.

```css
/* bugSolution.css */
@layer components {
  .my-component {
    @apply bg-blue-500 text-white p-4 rounded;
  }
}
```

The main stylesheet remains largely unchanged, just ensuring that the import statement still correctly references the `bugSolution.css` file.
