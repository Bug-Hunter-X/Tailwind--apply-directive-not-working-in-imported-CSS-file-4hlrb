The issue arises when using Tailwind's `@apply` directive within a CSS file, particularly when that CSS file is imported into a main CSS file using the `@import` rule.  The problem manifests as the `@apply` directive not correctly applying the specified utility classes. The classes are defined correctly in the Tailwind configuration, and there aren't any syntax errors within the `@apply` directives themselves. The imported CSS file is correctly imported into the main CSS file, and the styles from other parts of the imported CSS file work as expected. However, only the `@apply` directives fail to take effect.
